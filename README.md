# ATT-CK-audit-assess
AudiTT&amp;CK-is a CLI tool that generates predictive cybersecurity audit checklists based on real-world threat actor behavior. It maps adversary TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) from the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework to their corresponding mitigation and detection controls â€” then outputs them in a standardized control objective format.
